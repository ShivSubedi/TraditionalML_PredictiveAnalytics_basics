This directory will contain:
1. the data which will be tested to be fitted with linear regression model
2. analysis script building the linear regression model

Analytis steps of Simple Linear Regression Example
- Step 1: Import the relevant libraries
- Step2: Load the Data
- Step 3: Descriptive Statistics
- Step 4: Create Regression model
  - 4(A) Define the dependent and independent variables
  - 4(B) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - 4(C) Perform Regression analysis
- Step 5: Check if the assumptions of Linear Regression Model hold
  - 5(A) Linearity
  - 5(B) Independence (of observations)
  - 5(C) No-autocorelation (of residuals)
  - 5(D) Homoscedasticity (Constant Variance)
  - 5(E) Normality
- Step 6: Summarization of the violations in linearity assumptions and their impact
- Step 7: How to address the above violations in linearity assumption
